Angular is a framework for frontend development. 

Diff Framework Vs library is - 
Framework: Provides Structure (and Functionalities) and keeps the programs flow control
Library: Provides Functionalities and developer decides the program flow control

0. Node.js : NPM

#Day 03: Understanding Angular Project and component [27-JAN-2021]

Project structure 

Portfolio 
    |
    |-src
        |
        |-app
            |
            |-app.component.html
            |-app.component.css

Angular run on port 4200 by default.
We can change that port using a flag --port <portNumber>
            ng serve 
            ng serve --port 5000
            npm start
-main.ts: Entry point for angular app  
-test.ts: Entry Point for test 
-package.lock.js: list of packages and dependencies
-package.js: list of used packages

Command to generatte component: 

ng generate component <componentName>

Keywords to read more about:
main.ts 
AppModule
AppComponent
MVVM
 
Module [may have more than one components]
    -component [is made up of 4 files]
        -html
        -css 
        -spec.ts 
        -ts
Ex: 
AppModule 
    AppComponent

Day 04: Revising Prerequisites

CRP: Critical Rendering path 

1. DOM 
2. CSSOM 
3. Render tree
4. Layout 
5. Paint

-CSS is Render Blocking
-JS is Parser Blocking
-JS Runs after CSSOM Event and (might be) before DOM construction
-Render tree get formed only after DOM and CSSOM is ready
