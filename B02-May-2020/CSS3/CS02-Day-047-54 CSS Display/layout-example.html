            <h2>Use your Credit Card wisely</h2>

            <p>Credit cards come with legal contracts. Hence, it is important that you are aware of their terms and conditions, when you sign up for them.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Explore features and learn about T&Cs:</strong> Please read your credit card application carefully to know about your card’s features and associated Terms and Conditions. The information mentioned in small prints may have big impacts
                on your fees, charges and usage conditions. While some T&Cs are similar on all cards, there are many others that may be particular to the ones you are applying for, so we recommend that you go through all of them.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Understand liabilities:</strong> If your card has multiple users, know about the liabilities shared by secondary users. Also, if you have applied for Add-on cards, understand the added responsibilities that come with them such as who
                will manage the cards, pay bills and debts, etc.</p>
